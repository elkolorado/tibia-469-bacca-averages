## About
Bacca Chewie article about [The Hellgate's Averages](https://tibiasecrets.com/article.php?id=166), resolves around average of digits per book is around 4.5

This is close to random distribution of nubmers 0..9 / 10 = 4.5

## Theory

If this is true, the random generated string of numbers should show 4.5


## Useage

The `read_books.py` is used to generate `utils/books.json` from `books.txt`. The `books.txt` contains all books in 469.
The `books.json` contains the occurences of digits from all books, the length of each book, and the average of each book, along with list of all books

The `gen_rand.py` mimic the original 469 books, but is randomly generated by using rand length of each book between `35, 294` matching the original min and max of book lengths

## Run

To show 469 analysis just run `python average_theory.py` to display the 3 graphs as shown on above screen.

To show random analysis just run `python average_theory_rand.py`. Alternativly you can run `gen_rand.py` to reshuffle the random once again.


## Conclusion

While the average from all books shown is around 4.4, there are books really close to 4.5 that are marked on red. Meaning they are almost equal to normal distribution. Meaning they potentialy could be randomly generated. Other books aren't that close to it however.

Other fact is that the books itself contain repetitions. The 4.4 is present, but the occurence graph shows something far different from the normal distribution as shown on occurence graph using `average_theory_rand.py`. This could be bound to the fact the book contains repetitions, while randomly generated string doesnt offer that mechanic.
